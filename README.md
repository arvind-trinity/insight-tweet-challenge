#Average Degree of Tweets Hashtag Graph:

  The purpose of the program is to form a graph of hashtags and to compute the average degree (total degree/ number of vertices) for a given time window. But before doing this tweets have to be cleaned so that it has only ascii characters and no escape sequences, for simplicity tabs and new-line characters are converted into single space.
  
  As per requirement this is split into 2 scripts (1) To clean the inout tweets and print the number that is dirty at the end (2) Forms a graph with tweets over the given time window and prints the average degree for every new tweet.
